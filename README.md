# Stream2Podcast

Stream2Podcast lets you record audio streams (e.g. live radio) and create podcast feeds from the recordings.

## Features

-   Record a HTTP audio stream and save it to disk (works with audio streams following either ICY or HLS protocol)
-   Create multiple recording schedules to record at different time periods throughout the day (using [APScheduler - Advanced Python Scheduler](https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler))
-   Generate a podcast RSS feed from the recordings produced by each schedule (i.e. turns a recording schedule into a podcast with each recording representing an episode)
-   Publish as podcast: The output of `stream2podcast` makes it simple to set up a webserver (e.g. [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)) to serve the static files (RSS feed file + recordings) from the root of the output directory.
-   Docker support: Easy deployment using Docker Compose

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/holstt/stream2podcast.git
cd stream2podcast
```

**2. Set up configuration**

The project consists of two services: `recording-service` and `feed-service`. The `recording-service` is responsible for recording the audio streams and storing them on disk, while the `feed-service` is responsible for generating podcast RSS feeds based on these recordings. The two services run separately and are fully independent of each other. `feed-service` is simply monitoring the output directory of the `recording-service` for any changes, and will update the podcast RSS feed whenever a new recording is added for that particular podcast.

### recording-service

`./recording-service/config.example.yml` provides an example of the required configuration format:

```yaml
stream_url: "https://example.com"
output_dir: "../recordings" # Directory where recordings should be saved
time_zone: "Europe/Berlin" # IANA time zone name. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

# Specify one or more recording schedules
recording_schedules:
    - title: "morning program every weekday" # Will be used as the title of the podcast feed
      start_timeofday: "06:15" # Time as HH:MM (24-hour clock) in the specified time zone
      end_timeofday: "07:00"

      frequency: "mon, tue, wed, thu, fri" # Optional, defaults to '*' i.e. every day
      description: "This is a morning program" # Optional, will be used as the podcast description when generating the feed
      image_url: "https://example.com/image.png" # Optional, will be used as the podcast image when generating the feed

    - title: "afternoon program every weekday"
      start_timeofday: "13:05"
      end_timeofday: "14:00"
      frequency: "mon-fri" # Optional

    - title: "evening program on tuesdays and fridays"
      start_timeofday: "19:30"
      end_timeofday: "21:00"
      frequency: "tue, fri" # Optional
```

Rename the file to `config.yml` and adapt the configuration to your use case. Recording schedules are allowed to overlap, as the service supports parallel recording. If the service is started during a recording schedule, recording will start immediately.

`frequency` is a **day-of-week** cron expression which also supports abbreviated names (e.g. `"mon, tue, wed, thu, fri"` or `"mon-fri"`).

### feed-service

`./feed-service/config.example.yml` provides an example of the required configuration format:

```yaml
# Directory where feed-service should look for recordings.
base_dir: "../recordings"

# Base URL where the podcast feeds are served from
base_url: "https://podcasts.mydomain.com/"

# OPTIONAL: Whether to update feeds on startup. Defaults to false.
should_update_feeds_on_startup: true
```

Rename the file to `config.yml` and adapt the configuration to your use case.

`base_dir` should be set to the output directory used by `recording-service` (or any directory, as long as the contained files follows the file structure and name pattern specified in the **Usage** section). This directory will be monitored for changes, and the podcast feeds will be updated accordingly. A feed update is only triggered if a file change is registered and then no other changes occur for that file the next 5 minutes. This ensures that a feed update is not triggered while a recording is still in progress.

`base_url` is used to generate the episode URLs in the podcast feed, which will be in the format `https://<base_url>/<podcast_title>/<episode_filename>`.

Once the configuration files are set up, you can either run the program locally or using Docker Compose (see below).

## Local Installation üíª

\*Requires the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) package manager

First, cd into either `./recording-service` or `./feed-service` depending on which service you want to run.

**3. Install dependencies and create a virtual environment**

```
poetry install
```

**4. Activate the virtual environment**

```
poetry shell
```

**5. Run the project**

```
python ./main.py
```

-   You can specify a custom path for your configuration file using `./main.py -c path/to/config.yml`

## Docker üê≥

\*Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**3. From project root, navigate to the `./docker` folder**

```
cd docker
```

**4. Run the docker project using a helper script**

Please see the `docker_run.py` helper script, that can be used to run the docker project. The script ensures that host paths and permissions are set up correctly, and configures `docker-compose.yml` using environment variables. The container will run as the current user (rather than defaulting to root). The script requires a configuration `.ini` file passed as argument. An example is provided in `example.ini`. Then run:

```
python docker_run.py path/to/your/config.ini
```

For a simpler setup, just replace the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` with concrete values and delete the `user` property. Then run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Output

### recording-service

The `recording-service` automatically starts recording the audio stream following the recording schedules as specified in `./recording-service/config.yml`. The service creates a new directory for each recording schedule for storing the recordings produced by that schedule together with a metadata file.

The file structure of the output directory is as follows:

```bash
<output_dir>/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_schedule_1>/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_1>
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_2>
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.yml
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_schedule_2>/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

The name of a recording file follows the parsable and URL-friendly format:

`<date>--<start_time>-<end_time>--<name_of_recording>--<uuid>.mp3|mp4`

-   `<date>`: Date of recording in the format YYYY-MM-DD
-   `<start_time>`: Start time (UTC) of recording in the format HHMM (i.e. this can vary from the start time specified in the configuration file, if the service is started during a recording schedule)
-   `<end_time>`: End time (UTC) of recording in the format HHMM
-   `<name_of_recording>`: Sluggified name of the recording. (currently this is the same as the name of the recording schedule/podcast name)
-   `<uuid>`: A universally unique identifier (UUID)
-   `.mp3|mp4`: The file format, either .mp3 or .mp4

Example: `2023-04-03--1230-1400--recording-name--ee1ad7c6-95bf-4116-a1f8-060053e80a73.mp3`

### feed-service

The output of `recording-service` enables the `feed-service` to generate the corresponding podcast feeds. `feed-service` generates a podcast feed for each recording schedule, and each recording is represented as an episode in that feed. The resulting `feed.rss` file is saved in the same directory as the recordings. As such, the file structure of the output directory ends up looking like this:

```bash
<output_dir>/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_schedule_1>/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_1>
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <recording_2>
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feed.rss # <-- added by feed-service
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
