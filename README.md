# Stream2Podcast

Stream2Podcast lets you record audio streams (e.g. live radio) and create a podcast feed from the recordings.

## Features

- Record an audio stream and save it to disk
- Configure the program to record at specified time periods throughout the day
- Make recordings accessible in a private podcast feed (coming soon)

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/roedebaron/stream2podcast.git
cd stream2podcast
```

**2. Set up configuration**

`./config.example.json` provides an example of the configuration format:

```json
{
  "stream_url": "https://example.com",
  "output_dir": "recordings",
  "recording_periods": [
    {
      "name": "morning program",
      "start_time_utc": "06:15",
      "end_time_utc": "07:00"
    },
    {
      "name": "afternoon program",
      "start_time_utc": "13:05",
      "end_time_utc": "14:00"
    },
    {
      "name": "evening program",
      "start_time_utc": "19:30",
      "end_time_utc": "21:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rename the file to `./config.json` and specify the URL for the audio stream, one or more time periods to record (**NB: time should be in UTC**), and the output directory where recordings should be saved. Note that the start and end time for a recording period is not allowed to overlap with other recording periods as the recording process occurs sequentially.

Once the config file is set up, you can either run the program locally or using Docker Compose (see below).

## Local Installation üíª

\*Requires the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) package manager

**3. Install dependencies and create a virtual environment**

```
poetry install
```

**4. Activate the virtual environment**

```
poetry shell
```

**5. Run the project**

```
python ./main.py
```

- You can specify a custom path for your configuration file using `./main.py --config path/to/config.json`

## Docker üê≥

\*Requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**4. From project root, navigate to the `./docker` folder**

```
cd docker
```

**5. Build and run the Docker Compose project**

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

The program automatically starts recording the audio stream each day during the time periods specified in `config.json`. Recordings are saved in the output directory in format `YYYY-MM-DD__HH-MM-SS_name_of_recording.mp3`.

Enjoy!
